    "# Stock trading bot\n",
    "The objective of this notebook is to developp a stock trading bot, and test its efficency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "Get moooney\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "We will proceed in several steps: \n",
    "1. Identifying in which stocks to invest, using social media and yahoo finance\n",
    "2. Computing sentiment about the comments about those stocks on wallstreetbets and google news, using text summarization transformers and sentiment language processing\n",
    "3. Get live data about those stocks\n",
    "4. Come up with a method to know when to buy and sell our stocks (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)\n",
    "5. Testing our bot!\n",
    "6. Use reinforcement learning to train a model to buy and sell, and compare it with the classical bot\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "After the automatization of the MACD bot, it can bring up to 3% a day.\n",
    "The reinforcement bot is still in training, and losing a little bit of money for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggested next steps\n",
    "- Improve initialtization while using other market's data\n",
    "- Improving how I choose the amount to invest\n",
    "- Try woth cryptocurrencies on reddit, as then are maybe more related to popularity\n",
    "- Test other methodologies than MACD\n",
    "- Test twitter to identify stocks\n",
    "- Take into account buying and selling fees to brokers\n",
    "- Use which tickers brought the more money to train a ML model to improve their choosing\n",
    "- Put in place buying and selling tracking, to be able to compare it with the actual values at the end of the day\n",
    "- Improve text summarization (for now I only look at the first 300 characters of an article, but it coould be better to look at each article split in bits)\n",
    "- Add a way to track earnings per stock\n",
    "- improve MACD"

Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership. With a market capitalization of US$349m, TravelCenters of America is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about TravelCenters of America.  View our latest analysis for TravelCenters of America  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that TravelCenters of America does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at TravelCenters of America's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters. Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. It would\",\n",

Discord has reached out to potential buyers and Microsoft is one of them, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. One person said it was more likely to go public than sell itself. Earlier in the day, VentureBeat reported that Discord was exploring a sale and it was in final talks with a party. (https://bit.ly/3lEHa0I) Microsoft declined to comment, while Discord did not immediately respond to Reuters request. Discord, which is valued at around $7 billion as of last December, is a platform on which users coordinate group activities such as games, discussions and even virtual parties. The Xbox maker has been seeking to strengthen its video game offerings with $7.5 billion acquisition of ZeniMax Media last year, its biggest gaming acquisition ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the prospects of gaming companies as people stayed at home and turned to video games for entertainment during lockdowns. With its strong gaming business, Microsoft has also been looking to own mass social media platforms. Its last big social media deal was the $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016, while it failed in its bid for short video app TikTok's U.S. assets in September last year.

       "  \"Veteran wall street tech analyst Brent Thill has cautioned against buying stocks in the underperforming tech sector, with the exception of social media giant Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB). What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is “off limits right now” as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors. Thill said that compared to other companies in the tech sector, Facebook is a “cheap name.” “$15 of earnings power and a mid 20 [P/E] multiple on it, and you are at $350 to $375 on the stock. So you got a lot of upside still on Facebook. We like that,” the analyst added. See Also: After Months Of Bitter Fighting, Zuckerberg Now Sees Facebook Benefiting From Apple's Privacy Rule Changes Why It Matters: On Thursday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index showed a substantial recovery to end the day higher by 15.79 points or 0.1 percent at 12977.68, after tumbling 1.4 percent.

What Are Analyst Ratings? Analysts are specialists within banking and financial systems that typically report for specific stocks or within defined sectors. These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. Analysts can recommend \"buy\", \"sell\", \"hold\", or similar verbage for each stock based on that company\\'s recent performance. \"Buy\" indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock\\'s short-term or mid-term growth and is a recommendation to purchase the stock.

What Happened: The NLRB directed Tesla to rehire the union activist, Richard Ortiz, and compensate him for loss of earnings, other benefits and adverse tax consequences following his firing. Ortiz was part of an organizing campaign, “Fair Future at Tesla.” The NLRB said Tesla broke the law by “coercively interrogating” workers who attempted to unionize and for preventing them from speaking to the media without explicit written permission from the company. Tesla has been ordered to revise a confidentially agreement it provides to employees and inform them of their protected rights by posting notices nationwide and holding meetings at its Fremont, California factory. Further, Musk has been asked to remove his 2018 tweet that “unlawfully threatened” workers. The CEO’s tweet was in response to increased efforts by workers to form a union with the United Auto Workers at the Fremont factory. “Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union.

       "  'Billionaire investor Ray Dalio, the founder of the $150 billion hedge fund Bridgewater Associates — the world’s largest — made a case that there’s a “good probability” bitcoin could be outlawed, similar to when the U.S. government made it illegal to privately own gold. As Dalio points out in his upcoming book “The Changing World Order,” the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made it illegal for individuals to own gold “because government leaders didn’t want gold to compete with money and credit as a storehold of wealth.” Something similar could happen with bitcoin, which has surged against a backdrop of high levels of debt, low interest rates, a lot of liquidity and stimulus, and investors seeking alternatives to bonds and currencies. At the time of this writing, bitcoin’s price was near $56,559.98, spiking after Elon Musk tweeted that you can use it to buy Teslas (TSLA). “Every country treasures its monopoly on controlling the supply and demand. They don’t want other monies to be operating or competing, because things can get out of control. So I think that it would be very likely that you will have it under a certain set of circumstances outlawed the way gold was outlawed,” Dalio told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer in an episode of “Influencers with Andy Serwer,” a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment. Dalio pointed out that India’s government is currently exploring outlawing bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies altogether. “[We] have to see what that means,” the investor',\n",

       "  'By Nick Carey LONDON (Reuters) -Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler said on Wednesday it will accelerate its shift to electric cars as it builds on a strong start to 2021 despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, but gave no details of how fast its car line-up will go electric. The German company said it expected 2021 to be a significantly better year for revenue, and pretax profits than a pandemic-hit 2020. In common with German rivals BMW and Volkswagen, Daimler benefited from Chinese demand for high-margin luxury vehicles in the second half of 2020, which helped sales to recover from production shutdowns in the first part of the year. But a shortage of chips the auto industry uses in a range of functions, such as managing fuel economy and emergency braking, has meant much of the auto industry has struggled to maintain output. Daimler said it planned to speed up the electrification of its product range, but did not provide any specific detail. In 2019, Daimler said it expected plug-in hybrids or all-electric vehicles to make up more than 50% of its car sales by 2030 \"We want to accelerate the electrification of our product portfolio,\" Chief Executive Ola Källenius said. \"It\\'s our goal to reach this target sooner.\" When asked during a video conference call with investors why Daimler had not provided updated targets for accelerating electrification, the carmaker\\'s CEO said this would depend on many factors, including the availability of charging infrastructure for electric cars.

The deal is the biggest Japanese outbound acquisition of a U.S. hi-tech company on record, according to Refinitiv data.

The S&P 500 currently trades a shade under 4,000, which was the pair\\'s prior target price for the major index. The call is rooted in two expectations: low inflation and the inherent desire by investors to own stocks relative to other assets. \"We argue that we are in a very different policy environment.

The stock price slumped 23% last Wednesday after ViacomCBS announced pricing of its $3 billion stock sale in part to fund investment in streaming content, a move that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders. Wall Street analyst downgrades that cautioned that ViacomCBS was overvalued also put pressure on the shares. Then, on Friday, investment firm Archegos Capital Management was “forced by its banks to sell more than $20 billion worth of shares after some positions moved” against the firm, which is the family office of former Tiger Management portfolio manager Bill Hwang, Bloomberg reported. That include large block trades of ViacomCBS and Discovery stock, both of which tumbled more than 27% Friday. Shares of ViacomCBS closed at $45.01 Monday, down from a recent peak of $100.34 on March 22 (at which point the shares had zoomed up 174% since the start of 2021). Shares of Discovery declined 1.6% Monday; the company’s stock is down 47% from an all-time $77.27 per share on March 19. The price-to-earnings ratio for ViacomCBS stock was about 10.8 times as of market close Monday, down from 23.4 times in',\n",
       "  'Rumors of massive block trades have followed gyrations in the stock prices of some companies on Friday. A block trade involves a large number of shares and is privately negotiated between buyer and seller. Here is the latest on what may have transpired: IPO Edge reported late on Friday that \"several major investment banks\" with ties to Archegos Capital Management began liquidating holdings on Friday and helped push down the share prices of Discovery, Inc. and ViacomCBS Inc. Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) offered over 30 million shares of ViacomCBS, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) offered over 15 million shares of Discovery in block trades on Friday, IPO Edge said, citing people familiar with the matter. After Archegos was unable to meet a margin call from an investment bank, that bank began selling off stakes held by Archegos, according to one unnamed source cited by IPO Edge. It is not clear which bank that may have been — IPO Edge said it wasn\\'t necessarily Goldman or Morgan Stanley. Archegos Capital Management is led by Bill Hwang. It held and may still have large holdings of ViacomCBS and Discovery, according to IPO Edge. Hwang was the founder of Tiger Asia Management LLC, which no longer is in business. Shares of ViacomCBS, which trade under the name CBS Corporation Common Stock (NASDAQ: VIAC), ended Friday\\'s trading down 27.31% at $48.23, after bottoming at $39.81. DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS INC.

Earlier in the day, VentureBeat reported that Discord was exploring a sale and it was in final talks with a party. (https://bit.ly/3lEHa0I) Microsoft declined to comment, while Discord did not immediately respond to Reuters request. Discord, which is valued at around $7 billion as of last December, is a platform on which users coordinate group activities such as games, discussions and even virtual parties. The Xbox maker has been seeking to strengthen its video game offerings with $7.5 billion acquisition of ZeniMax Media last year, its biggest gaming acquisition ever. The COVID-19 pandemic has boosted the prospects of gaming companies as people stayed at home and turned to video games for entertainment during lockdowns. With its strong gaming business, Microsoft has also been looking to own mass social media platforms. Its last big social media deal was the $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn in 2016, while it failed in its bid for short video app TikTok's U.S. assets in September last year.

      "Every investor in TravelCenters of America Inc. (NASDAQ:TA) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. Generally speaking, as a company grows, institutions will increase their ownership. Conversely, insiders often decrease their ownership over time. Companies that have been privatized tend to have low insider ownership. With a market capitalization of US$349m, TravelCenters of America is a small cap stock, so it might not be well known by many institutional investors. Our analysis of the ownership of the company, below, shows that institutions are noticeable on the share registry. We can zoom in on the different ownership groups, to learn more about TravelCenters of America.  View our latest analysis for TravelCenters of America  Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices. We can see that TravelCenters of America does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at TravelCenters of America's earnings history below.

What Happened: The Jefferies analyst said on Yahoo Finance Live that tech is “off limits right now” as investors put more money into travel and airline stocks amid hopes of a strong economic recovery from the pandemic. According to the analyst, valuation combined with the tech names could currently be frustrating a lot of investors. Thill said that compared to other companies in the tech sector, Facebook is a “cheap name.” “$15 of earnings power and a mid 20 [P/E] multiple on it, and you are at $350 to $375 on the stock. So you got a lot of upside still on Facebook. We like that,” the analyst added.

What Are Analyst Ratings? Analysts are specialists within banking and financial systems that typically report for specific stocks or within defined sectors. These people research company financial statements, sit in conference calls and meetings, and speak with relevant insiders to determine what are known as analyst ratings for stocks. Typically, analysts will rate each stock once a quarter. Analysts can recommend \"buy\", \"sell\", \"hold\", or similar verbage for each stock based on that company's recent performance. \"Buy\" indicates that an analyst is optimistic about a stock's short-term or mid-term growth and is a recommendation to purchase the stock. On the other hand, \"Sell\" implies that an analyst forecasts a downwards trend for the stock. \"Hold\" suggests that investors should maintain their positions on that stock because of forecasted stagnation or lack of new information. Some analysts publish their predictions for metrics such as growth estimates, earnings, and revenue to provide additional guidance with their ratings.

      "The National Labor Relations Board has ruled that Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) violated labor laws when it fired a union activist in 2017. The federal agency also ordered CEO Elon Musk to remove an “unlawful tweet” in 2018 that threatened Tesla workers hoping to unionize. What Happened: The NLRB directed Tesla to rehire the union activist, Richard Ortiz, and compensate him for loss of earnings, other benefits and adverse tax consequences following his firing. Ortiz was part of an organizing campaign, “Fair Future at Tesla.” The NLRB said Tesla broke the law by “coercively interrogating” workers who attempted to unionize and for preventing them from speaking to the media without explicit written permission from the company. Tesla has been ordered to revise a confidentially agreement it provides to employees and inform them of their protected rights by posting notices nationwide and holding meetings at its Fremont, California factory. Further, Musk has been asked to remove his 2018 tweet that “unlawfully threatened” workers. The CEO’s tweet was in response to increased efforts by workers to form a union with the United Auto Workers at the Fremont factory. “Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare,” Musk had said in the tweet.

These “lemon laws” vary by state, but in general any new car owner who has been sold a lemon has the right to a complete refund, or “buy back.” Tesla provides its customers with a long list of their lemon law rights here. New car buyers have a certain time period to exercise their lemon law rights. Florida law, for instance, stipulates a car buyer has 24 months to make a lemon-law claim to the seller. The car seller is typically entitled to a few attempts to fix the car. But if it can’t, then the state’s lemon law is triggered and the\n",

      "Per Electrek, Tesla TSLA recently clinched a new contract for supplying 10 electric semi-trucks and two Megachargers with roughly $2 million in the U.S. government support.The Tesla Semi was unveiled in 2017, the production of which has been delayed a number of times since then. It was first supposed to hit the market in 2019. Still, this has not stopped the U.S.-based auto giant from taking reservations with large deposits for the electric truck. Currently, there are several government incentive schemes trying to help enhance the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. This has aided a company to secure the funding needed for acquiring the Tesla Semi trucks.Reportedly, MHX Leasing LLC, a California-based logistics company, has secured $1.9 million for acquiring 10 Tesla Semi class 8 trucks, and $560,000 for purchasing two overhead electric cranes form the Mobile Source Air Pollution Reduction Review Committee (MSRC).The MSRC provides funding for clean transportation on California’s Southern coast. The deal also includes Tesla deploying two Megachargers at MHX’s Fontana distribution facility in California, for charging these vehicles. The Megacharger is Tesla’s latest charging solution for its Tesla Semi with a capacity expected to exceed 1 MW.Notably, in order to standardize the Megacharger, Tesla has been working with CharIN, an industry association behind the CCS standard, to build High Power Charging for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV).New prototypes (the first new ones in three years) for Tesla semi-electric trucks have been recently produced by the automaker.

      "(Reuters) - The U.S. auto safety agency said on Monday that it will collect information about an accident in which a Tesla vehicle crashed into a tractor-trailer in New Jersey. The Tesla driver, a 44-year-old, said he had his cruise control on \"when he momentarily lost focus on the roadway\" and drove his car under the trailer on Monday morning, according to a statement from the South Brunswick Township Police Department. \"The impact was so severe it shredded the roof off the passenger's side of the vehicle.\" The Tesla was destroyed in the crash, but the driver received minor injuries. \"NHTSA is aware of the Tesla crash on March 29 in New Jersey. We have contacted Tesla and local law enforcement regarding this crash and will act accordingly when we have more information,\" a representative of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement to Reuters.

Upbeat Expectations For Tesla:  Although Tesla did not give a ballpark figure for 2021 deliveries, the ongoing sales momentum is likely to continue. The company is coming off a year in which it delivered a record 499,550 vehicles. First-quarter deliveries are expected at 170,000 units, which suggests a 92% year-over-year increase, RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said, citing checks and regionally reported data. This represents a 6% quarter-over-quarter decline and a scale back from Spak's earlier estimate of 182,000. Breaking down deliveries by model, the RBC analyst estimates 164,800 Model 3/Y deliveries and 5,300 Model S/X deliveries. Tesla may have produced 170,000 cars in the quarter, with 96,000 expected to have been rolled out of its Fremont factory and 74,000 from its Shanghai Giga, Spak said.

Subscribe Monday, March 8, 2021 The recent bout of volatility in the bond market has investors concerned about what a sustained rally in interest rates could mean for stocks. Rising interest rates mean rising borrowing costs, which doesn't sound great for stocks. Also, higher yields arguably make bonds more attractive as an investment, which doesn't sound great for stocks either. And so it's not too surprising to see stocks trade lower (^GSPC) in the past month as yields (^TNX) have surged. However, financial markets are a bit more complicated than that. And it's the case that there are plenty of sound reasons to be bullish even in light of higher rates. Demand for stocks is strong Lower stock prices belie robust demand for the asset class. \"Equity mutual fund and ETF inflows have totaled $163 billion since the start of February, the largest five-week inflow on record in absolute dollar terms and third largest in a decade relative to assets,\" Goldman Sachs' David Kostin observed on Friday. \"Even though the recent backup in rates has weighed on equity prices broadly, the pace of inflows into equity funds during the last few weeks has accelerated compared with the start of the year.\" This isn't some historical anomaly either. \"History shows that equity funds generally experience inflows when real rates are rising,\" Kostin added. \"During the past\n",

As Dalio points out in his upcoming book “The Changing World Order,” the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 made it illegal for individuals to own gold “because government leaders didn’t want gold to compete with money and credit as a storehold of wealth.” Something similar could happen with bitcoin, which has surged against a backdrop of high levels of debt, low interest rates, a lot of liquidity and stimulus, and investors seeking alternatives to bonds and currencies.

      "By Nick Carey LONDON (Reuters) -Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler said on Wednesday it will accelerate its shift to electric cars as it builds on a strong start to 2021 despite a global semiconductor chip shortage, but gave no details of how fast its car line-up will go electric. The German company said it expected 2021 to be a significantly better year for revenue, and pretax profits than a pandemic-hit 2020. In common with German rivals BMW and Volkswagen, Daimler benefited from Chinese demand for high-margin luxury vehicles in the second half of 2020, which helped sales to recover from production shutdowns in the first part of the year. But a shortage of chips the auto industry uses in a range of functions, such as managing fuel economy and emergency braking, has meant much of the auto industry has struggled to maintain output. Daimler said it planned to speed up the electrification of its product range, but did not provide any specific detail. In 2019, Daimler said it expected plug-in hybrids or all-electric vehicles to make up more than 50% of its car sales by 2030 \"We want to accelerate the electrification of our product portfolio,\" Chief Executive Ola Källenius said. \"It's our goal to reach this target sooner.\" When asked during a video conference call with investors why Daimler had not provided updated targets for accelerating electrification, the carmaker's CEO said this would depend on many factors, including the availability of charging infrastructure for electric cars.

      "By Makiko Yamazaki and Sam Nussey TOKYO (Reuters) -Hitachi Ltd said on Wednesday it will buy U.S. software company GlobalLogic Inc for $9.6 billion, including repayment of debt, as the Japanese industrial conglomerate pivots from electronics hardware to digital services. The deal is the biggest Japanese outbound acquisition of a U.S. hi-tech company on record, according to Refinitiv data. The acquisition is part of Hitachi's ongoing business portfolio overhaul, which includes the $7 billion acquisition of ABB Ltd's power grid business last year and a series of divestitures of its domestic hardware subsidiaries. Hitachi's stock tumbled 7% on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, its sharpest daily fall in more than a year, on the news. San Jose-based GlobalLogic is currently owned 45% each by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Swiss investment firm Partners Group. The rest is owned by the company's management. Founded in 2000, GlobalLogic has more than 20,000 employees in 14 countries and offers software engineering services to 400 active clients in industries including automotive, healthcare, and finance. GlobalLogic's expertise stretches from chips to cloud services and will extend the range of Hitachi's own digital services business, company executives told a news conference. Past GlobalLogic projects include working with McDonald's on its customer app and in-store digital ordering system and with chipmaker Qualcomm on a fingerprint recognition system, according to its website. Hitachi aims to close the transaction, which will be funded with cash and bank loans, by the end of July. The conglomerate is in talks with\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- The stocks at the center of the Archegos Capital Management crisis posted gains Tuesday as fallout from the fund’s liquidation appeared to be contained and no additional block trades were reported. ViacomCBS Inc. rose 3.6% in New York following its weeklong plunge, with Discovery Inc. and Tencent Music Entertainment Group both climbing more than 4%. The American depositary receipts of Chinese companies also gained, with GSX Techedu Inc. boosted by a planned stock purchase by its chief executive officer, and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. helped by a $500 million buyback proposal. Shares in the companies, which also include Baidu Inc., Farfetch Ltd. and Iqiyi Inc., have had a rocky couple of sessions following the forced liquidation of positions linked to Bill Hwang’s Archegos, with ViacomCBS down 55% in the five trading days through Monday. While investors remain nervous about the potential for more liquidations, there have been no signs yet of a broader contagion. The S&P 500 Index slipped about 0.3%. “Market participants will be glad to see this has so far been contained -- though there may be some more trades related to Archegos that need unwinding,” Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said by email. “Banks left holding the bag -- which look to be Nomura and Credit Suisse more than others -- will suffer significant losses.” Banks roiled by the Archegos Capital fallout may see total losses in the range of $5 billion to $10 billion, according to JPMorgan.

A l'occasion du dernier tirage de l'Euromillions vendredi 26 février, Rachel Kennedy, 19 ans, et Liam McCrohan, 21 ans, sont ainsi passés tout près d'un jackpot de 210 millions d'euros.

Moreover, demand remains healthy for other Apple devices including iPad, Mac and Wearables. Although Apple didn’t provide any guidance due to uncertainties triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, it expects the top-line to grow in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.  Moreover, Apple’s near-term prospects are bright, driven by new iPhones that support 5G, revamped iPad and Mac line-up of devices, health-focused Apple Watch 6 and robust growth in the Services business.

      "Watch: Amazon backed Deliveroo slumps in trading debut Deliveroo's (ROO.L) share price plunged as much as 30% on its IPO debut on the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Shares were priced at 390p but dropped to 331p at the open. They were trading as low as 276p shortly after. The slump knocked £2bn ($2.7bn) off the company's value.  Deliveroo's 390p offer price had valued the business at £7.6bn. On Monday, the startup had said it cut its potential valuation, following a revolt from the City of London over the company's treatment of drivers. Several of the City of London's biggest money managers — including Aviva (AV.L), Aberdeen Standard Life (SLA.L), L&G (LGEN.L), and M&G (MNG.L) — have publicly said they will not take part in Deliveroo's IPO. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The flexible employee model of Deliveroo’s riders is a huge pillar of the group’s plans for success. If forced to offer more traditional employee benefits, like company pension contributions, Deliveroo’s already thin margins would struggle to climb, and the road to profitability would look very tough indeed.\" Deliveroo said it intends to use the net proceeds from the issue of new shares to continue to invest in growth opportunities. \"Bringing the food category online represents an enormous market opportunity.

      "Stocks jumped to record levels on Wednesday as technology stocks recovered losses from Tuesday's session. Traders digested the contours of President Joe Biden's infrastructure proposal, which would include trillions of dollars in government spending as well as new changes to tax policy.  The S&P 500 rose by 0.6% to reach a fresh record intraday high. The Nasdaq outperformed, gaining 1.7% as technology stocks outperformed. The Dow hovered near the flat line. A day earlier, the Dow dropped for the first time in four sessions, and each of the S&P 500 and Nasdaq also declined. Shares of big bank stocks recovered some declines from earlier this week, though shares of Nomura and Credit Suisse added to losses as the lenders assessed the losses they would incur after the hedge fund Archegos Capital defaulted on significant margin calls last week.   Traders will be eyeing President Joe Biden's latest public address on Wednesday, which is expected to include details around his infrastructure plan for the country. The White House released a statement about the plan ahead of the address, noting that it would involve more than $2 trillion in total spending over eight years to help rehabilitate and build out the country's infrastructure, address the crisis around climate change and curb economic inequality. To pay for the proposal, Biden will propose raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% for 15 years, and implementing other policies to disincentivize offshoring.  Wednesday also marks the final session of both March and the first quarter.\n"

      "The portfolio strategist team of Inigo Fraser-Jenkins and Alla Harmsworth at AllianceBernstein are out with a new long-term call on S&P 500, and it's a headline-grabber — especially now amidst a renewed bout of volatility after the blowup of Bill Hwang's family office. Over the next eight and a half years, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) could reach 8,000, says the duo. The S&P 500 currently trades a shade under 4,000, which was the pair's prior target price for the major index. The call is rooted in two expectations: low inflation and the inherent desire by investors to own stocks relative to other assets. \"We argue that we are in a very different policy environment. For the first time in at least a decade there is a plausible narrative for why inflation may rise. In addition, there are also reasons why rates may not respond as quick to inflationary signals. This leaves us with the prospect of persistent low real yields which can justify market valuations,\" explain the two strategists in an extensive 16-page research note obtained by Yahoo Finance. And with the prospect of low long-term inflation, equity investors will be hard pressed not to bite consistently at the apple. That's even if valuations on equities look rich on the surface.

ViacomCBS (VIAC) plans to invest the net proceeds from the sale in its streaming services. However, the tough competitive landscape and execution risk is keeping investors on edge and has led to a sharp sell-off in the stock. Notably, VIAC has lost about 28% of its value in the last three trading days. ViacomCBS’s stock offerings comprise of two concurrent offerings of 20 million shares of its Class B common stock and 10 million shares of Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The company priced the Class B common stock offering at $85 per share and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering at $100 per share. The offering is anticipated to close on March 26. (See ViacomCBS stock analysis on TipRanks) On March 22, Benchmark analyst Daniel Kurnos raised the stock’s price target to $120 (71% upside potential) from $80 and reiterated a Buy rating. Kurnos remains upbeat on VIAC’s prospects and expects it to crush near-term estimates. He expects VIAC stock to trend higher.

Shares of the media conglomerate slipped another 6.7% in regular trading Monday — and the company’s market value has now been chopped by 55% since March 22. ViacomCBS has been beset by a confluence of factors that have crashed its stock price, after a huge run-up to start the year on enthusiasm for its direct-to-consumer streaming push. The stock price slumped 23% last Wednesday after ViacomCBS announced pricing of its $3 billion stock sale in part to fund investment in streaming content, a move that would dilute the equity of existing shareholders. Wall Street analyst downgrades that cautioned that ViacomCBS was overvalued also put pressure on the shares.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: GS) offered over 30 million shares of ViacomCBS, and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) offered over 15 million shares of Discovery in block trades on Friday, IPO Edge said, citing people familiar with the matter. After Archegos was unable to meet a margin call from an investment bank, that bank began selling off stakes held by Archegos, according to one unnamed source cited by IPO Edge. It is not clear which bank that may have been — IPO Edge said it wasn't necessarily Goldman or Morgan Stanley. Archegos Capital Management is led by Bill Hwang. It held and may still have large holdings of ViacomCBS and Discovery, according to IPO Edge. Hwang was the founder of Tiger Asia Management LLC, which no longer is in business.
