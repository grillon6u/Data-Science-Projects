# Data-Science-projects

This repository presents all my personal projects and work related to data science. The repository is split in three sections: Analytics, Data Science and template.

## Analytics projects

This section contains all projects and work related to Analytics. This means, all projects related to the following topics: Data Analysis, Mining and Visualizations. 
For now, it contains three distinct projects: multiplayer survey analysis, powerbi-training, and hackerrank SQL solutions. No further projects are planned for now.

### Multiplayer market analysis

### PowerBI training

### Hackerrank SQL

## Data science projects

This section contains all projects and work related to Data Science. This means, all projects related to the following topics: Webscrapping, Data exploration, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing.
For now, it contains two distinct projects: housing prediction, tennis sentiment analysis.
Further projects are still work in progress and will soon be added: computer vision (face mask detection) using deep learning, image classifier using machine learning / image generator using GANs.

### Housing prediction regression (EDA, ML)

### Tennis sentiment analysis (Webscrapping, twitter scrapping, NLP)
